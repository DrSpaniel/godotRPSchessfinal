# GodotChess

<H1>Chess made in godot using c# and stockfish as the chess engine.</H1>

Common rules like pawn doublepushes, en passant and castling are implemented, 3 fold repetition and 50 move rule are not.

It uses stockfish as the chess engine for the ai, this is done running the stockfish program as a process from c# and using the uci protocol to comunicate with it.

I do not own the sprites and the sounds (they are from chess.com hehe)
